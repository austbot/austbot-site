      <description>My name is Austin Adams and I am a Software Engineer. I have at least 10 years of experience creating amazing software for both man and machine. I&amp;rsquo;m people oriented, fast learning and excited to challenge tough problems with modern solutions. As a contributor sometimes and an overseer other times I know how to to lead and follow with wisdom in a team setting. I enjoy all aspects of the development process and because of that I know how to see a project through all stages of execution.</description>
